# Lunar-Lander
The aim of the simulation is to find the acceleration to which a spacecraft land safely( without crashing )on the lunar surface.

---------

###### At the start the Lander will be at initial height H. We assume Lander velocity is zero
$$v=0$$

###### There are only two conditions
-----
-  Lander is in free fall its acceleration is

------

$$a = -g$$ (where g is lunar gravitational acceleration)

(Note that a vector is a physical quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction. In our case the direction can only be up (+) or down (-) ).
